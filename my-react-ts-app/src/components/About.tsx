          <p>
            I'm a Computer Science student at the University of San Carlos with a passion for web development
            and problem-solving. I love creating modern, responsive web applications that provide great user
            experiences.

          <p>
            Currently, I'm focused on mastering React and TypeScript while building various projects to
            enhance my skills. My goal is to become a full-stack developer and contribute to meaningful
            projects that make a difference.
